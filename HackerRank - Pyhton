Task

Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird


### MY CODE
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
    
if n%2==1:
    print("Weird")
elif 2 <= n <= 5:
    print("Not Weird")
elif 6 <= n <= 20:
    print("Weird")
else:
    print("Not Weird")





n = int(input().strip())                          # We just take the input, remove any excess whitespace and store the integer in a variable
check = {True: "Not Weird", False: "Weird"}       # We define a dictionary with boolean values as keys

print( check [n%2==0 and (n in range(2,6) or n > 20)] )

# Checking if the input number is even. If it isn't, the expression will automatically return False,
# the dictionary outputs Weird and the print function prints the string on the console
# If the input number is indeed even, we then check if it's in the range from 2 to 6 or if it's more than 20 
# If either of these are true, the expression returns True, the dictionary outputs "Not Weird" and that will be printed on the screen. 
# If neither of these expressions are true, the expression returns False; thus, "Weird"





n = int(raw_input())    # We use rawinput() function to get input from user

if n%2==0 and (n in range(2,6) or n>20 ):
    print "Not",
print "Weird"
