When any kind of centralized service is used, the user is exposed to (not an exhaustive list):
* Arbitrary changes to Terms of Service
* Service shutting down
* Censorship
* Manipulation (e.g. skewed search results)
* Data "insights" used for more "personalized" advertising



When a new trend emerges, it generally needs many improvements in these areas:
*	UX
*	Scalability
*	Security & privacy
As long as these issues are not solved, that new trend will not be able to have its own "Netscape moment" (The term refers to the 1994 launch of the web browser that made it easy for ordinary people to surf the Internet) and become more than a buzzword
